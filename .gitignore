# The .gitignore file contains the files to be excluded from git source control. The .cfignore file contains the set of
# files to ignore when deploying to Bluemix. The two list of files are similar but not the same. However, they should
# be maintained in parallel. Any file that's added to one should be added to the other. If that file should not be
# ignored in that particular file it should be moved to the appropriate section and commented out.
